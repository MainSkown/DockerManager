# Docker Manager

## Session manager
On login user gets a session token (token from now on) in a cookie, 
that he/she uses to authenticate. 

In future implement token rotation (if necessary).

## TODO
- api calls:
  - creating new container (with git link to clone)
  - checking status
  - turning on containers (one/all)
  - setting to be always on
- brute force protection
